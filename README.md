# Cybersecurity-Bots (Prompts)
This is a repository of ChatGPT prompts to initiate different bots supporting cybersecurity professionals in their daily work.

*Please note:* This repository and the prompts therein are mainly designed to identify potential use cases of tools such as ChatGPT for cybersecurity professionals. Obviously, you should not assume every answer to be correct and use your judgement to challenge ChatGPT's answers.

## Development Tracker

- [x] Basic Cybersecurity Consulting Bot ([Link to prompt](./base-cybersecurity-bot.txt))
- [ ] Threat Assessment Bot
- [ ] Security Code Review Bot


## How to use these prompts

1. Click on any of the .txt files in this repository
2. Click on "Raw" to get the contents of the selected file presented in a new tab
3. Select all text (CMD or STRG + A) and copy it (CMD or STRG + C)
4. Paste the text into a new conversation with ChatGPT
5. Use the bot as defined

*Please note:* I would recommend to use the GPT-4 model in ChatGPT as it seems to be less prone to hallucination compared to GPT-3.5.

You can always update or modify the bot.

## Is this really a bot?

Well, yes and no. No, it's not some shiny new tool or automated bot ready to do all of your work but essentially a shortcut to focus ChatGPT on a specific topic.
Yes, it will save you some time but please remember: *Please review all answers from ChatGPT before making any decisions (reach out to professionals)*.

## I have an idea to extend your bots/prompts

Great, I'd love to hear more about your idea or feedback. Please create an issue in this repository and tell me more about it :smile:
